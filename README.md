A self host solution to watch for inputs.

Inputs are anything that can produce outputs, it may be a api url our any other
way to produce outputs.

An admin app and rss feed is provided to check the inputs/outputs for a given
provider and generate a rss/atom/json feed for the inputs by provider.

Apps to sync inputs and fetch outputs from inputs also exists.

Check src/common/providers for the available inputs and outputs.
